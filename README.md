# h5bp-v5.3.0-compass

## Description
This is my setup for a new web project with HTML5 Boilerplate v5.3.0, Normalize v4.1.1 &amp; Compass/SASS.


### CSS Files (/css) ###
The base CSS file (/css/main.css) is pre-compiled importing the HTML5 Boilerplate approved normalize.css. If compass is watching the /compass/sass folder then all your edits will truncate over main.css.

### JavaScript Files (/js) ###
Libraries are stored in the /js/vendor folder, including the minified jQuery v1.12.0 and minified Modernizr v2.8.3.
There is a starter file (main.js) supplied so you can start writing base JavaScript and a dedicated plugin file (plugin.js) for better control over third party dependencies

### Image Files (/img) ###
Create a folder named /img at trunk level and place your images there. You can also create additional folders to use with the Compass spriting engine (make sure to include @import "sprites/*.png" in base stylesheet).
